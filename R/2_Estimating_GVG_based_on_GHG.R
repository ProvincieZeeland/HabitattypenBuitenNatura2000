### Script 2: estimating GVG based on GHG

### Estimating GVG based on GHG, using a linear model
### Based on GVG and GHG maps from Deltares (unpublished)
### Expected GVG will be used in script 3 to calculate groundwater depth suitability


## Load in GHG, GVG and NBP Zeeland (for extent of nature areas)
GHG = raster('sources/groundwater_depth/ghg-mediaan.tif')
GVG = raster('sources/groundwater_depth/gvg-mediaan.tif')
NBP <- st_read('sources/ext_nat_nbp.gpkg')

## crop GHG and GVG on Zeeland
GHG <- crop(GHG, st_bbox(NBP))
GVG <- crop(GVG, st_bbox(NBP))

## resample GVG to GHG (GVG has less points)
GVG_resamp = round(resample(GVG, GHG, "bilinear"))

plot(GVG_resamp) ## there are still enough locations left to perform a test on

## Make a dataframe of both GVG and GHG values
data <- data.frame(GVG = getValues(GVG_resamp), GHG = getValues(GHG))
data <- na.omit(data)

## make a simple plot to show the linear relationship
plot(getValues(GVG_resamp) ~ getValues(GHG))

## fit a linear model between GVG and GHG
LM1 <- lm(GVG ~ GHG, data = data)

## visual model diagnostics
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))    # Plot in a 2x2 grid
plot(LM1, which = 1)    # Residuals vs fitted
plot(LM1, which = 2)    # use plot(LM, which = 2) in case of errors #qqPlot(LM1, reps = 1e4)
plot(LM1, which = 3)    # Scale-location
plot(LM1, which = 5)    # Cook's distance vs leverage
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))    # Restore the default  
# Residuals vs Fitted: Linearity is OK, 
# Q-Q Residuals: residuals are also somewhat normally distributed. At least there are no gaps
# Scale-Location: residuals have a constant variance
# Residuals vs Leverage: there are a few outliers, but they have a very small leverage. No real problems

## The assumptions are all met, so we can make the regression table
modelsummary <- summary(LM1)
modelsummary

## GVG and GHG are significantly correlated
## When GHG is 0, GVG is approximately 42. When GHG increases by 1, GVG increases by 0.9035
